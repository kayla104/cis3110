# cis3110

I created this dashboard for a project for my cis3110 class. We were assigned to create an online analytics dashboard using HTML, CSS, and Chart.js. We were supposed to have at least five charts on the page, as well as columns to align everything horizontally and vertically. I chose to create my dashboard based around National Park visits, because I love to hike and visit national parks. I thought it would be fun to dive into the data showing how many visits the parks get and what time of year brings in the most visitors. I started by mapping out a basic layout for my dashboard, drawing out the columns and rows with the boxes for each visual. I then created the individual visuals using Chart.js and populated the boxes on my dashboard. There is a navigation pane on the left and a header bar along the top.
